                <h2>As a user myself, I enjoy every “Aha” moment I have when I am using products. As a designer, I empathize with users, thinking of how users are probably thinking and feeling right now. I apply this to design, trying to find the “Aha” moment on a product and looking deeply to improve parts that are not user friendly.</h2>

                <h1>How I do it</h1>
                <h2>I enjoy the process of creation and the results obtained. Under the influence of both Chinese and Western cultures, my thinking has changed differently from others. During these 8 years of overseas study, I have found my passion, and discovered what I want to do and what I am interested in. It is very important to do just what I love.</h2>

                    Thank you for every encounter, every opportunity, and for the results this city has brought me.</h2>
